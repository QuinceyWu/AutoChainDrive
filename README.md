# Decentralized Autonomous Driving with Blockchain

This project aims to explore the integration of blockchain technology in creating a decentralized autonomous driving system. By leveraging blockchain, we aim to achieve secure and efficient vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) data sharing, enhancing the capabilities and safety of autonomous driving technologies.

## Objectives
- **Secure Data Sharing**: Utilize blockchain for secure and immutable data exchanges between vehicles and infrastructure.
- **Decentralization**: Implement a decentralized network that eliminates single points of failure, enhancing the robustness of the autonomous driving ecosystem.
- **Real-time Traffic Management**: Develop algorithms for real-time traffic optimization, route planning, and congestion avoidance.
- **Privacy Preservation**: Ensure the privacy of users and sensitive data through encryption and smart contract controls.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Blockchain Selection**: Choose a suitable blockchain platform considering scalability, speed, and smart contract capabilities.
2. **Smart Contract Development**: Design and develop smart contracts for data sharing, authentication, and transaction management.
3. **Vehicle Client Application**: Create client applications for vehicles to interact with the blockchain, send data, and receive updates.
4. **Simulation and Testing**: Test the system in simulated environments to ensure performance and security.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the system in a controlled real-world environment for pilot testing.
